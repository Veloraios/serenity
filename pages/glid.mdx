# Glid (aka clown)


tries to say "too bad this is gonna be apart of WSF, I'd love to collaborate with this otherwise" as if anyone is gonna collab anyway, dont fall into his traps, he will try to be nice once he finds out you have a project this is because he will copy ui off your projects or add a feature from your project to mysign and definitely not credit you. he will also leak your project if he does not like you so watch out for clowns like him..

dont even provide an url to your project he will inspect the code of the page.
