This is Serenity, a Powerful iOS/iPadOS Third Party Store (PWA) allowing you to Install/Sign and Configure .ipa files. It also lets you switch from a Repo to another but sadly, This App does not have fully working Repo Support. We also have a "Tweak Page" it lets you install Virtual Jailbreaks/Emulators/Fake Package Managers all for Fun, this works by installing .mobileconfig's and it Works For All iOS/iPadOS Versions.
