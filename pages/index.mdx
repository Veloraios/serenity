## What is Serenity?

This is Serenity, a powerful iOS/iPadOS Third Party Store (PWA) allowing you to Install/Sign and Configure .ipa files. It also lets you switch from a Repo to another but sadly, this App does not have fully working Repo Support. We also have a "Tweak Page" that lets you install Virtual Jailbreaks/Emulators/Fake Package Managers all for fun. This works by installing .mobileconfig's and it works for all iOS/iPadOS Versions.
